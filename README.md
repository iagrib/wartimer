# WarTimer

This small addon is designed mainly for RP servers - it lets you split game time into phases. Current phase and time before next phase will be displayed on screen.

Check out `config.lua` - configure the addon there! (add/edit phases, commands, etc.)

There is also an alternate theme for the timer available, see `alternate_hud.lua`.

---

This addon was originally written for another person who turned out not to need it, so hopefully someone else will find it useful!
